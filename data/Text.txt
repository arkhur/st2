 '2023 Annual Report\nWater Corporation\n Chair’s report \n Mr Ross Love Chair’s reportI am delighted to present  \nWater Corporation’s  2022-23 Annual Report. \nDespite prevailing economic and geopolitical challenges, Water Corporation has continued to deliver strongly on its purpose to sustainably manage and deliver water services across our great state.\nIn late-2022, we welcomed our new Minister \nfor Water, the Hon. Simone McGurk MLA. The Board wishes previous Water Minister Dave Kelly every success in his future endeavours and looks forward to building a strong working relationship with Minister McGurk.\nWith the introduction of Thrive2035, our new \ncorporate strategy, we have renewed our focus on delivering maximum value to our customers, communities and state so they may continue to thrive, now and long into the future.  \nThis financial year, under the direction of \nChief Executive Officer (CEO) Pat Donovan, we have remained resilient through natural disasters, supply chain shortages, and challenges brought about by climate change and a growing population.  \nIt’s this resilience and adaptability \nthat will be crucial into the future. \nWith the support of the State Government, \nwe actively pursued investment in rainfall independent water sources and played our part in helping to position WA as a frontrunner in the creation of renewable energy sources.\nI’m proud to also share the early success of our \nstrategic plan, highlighted by progress made \nto date on Perth’s next major water source – a \nproposed seawater desalination plant in Alkimos. To meet the plant’s renewable energy \nrequirements, and those of our existing desalination plants, we are working to competitively procure up to 400 megawatts (MW) of additional renewable energy, reflecting our commitment towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. \nWe took a significant step towards this \nambitious target in the last financial year, securing development rights to Flat Rocks Wind Farm Stage Two near Kojonup.  \nAs an organisation, we have taken care to \nidentify and integrate environmental, social, and governance considerations into our strategic planning and business processes. This includes providing safe and secure water to meet United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #6.\nWe are excited to help drive lasting \nimpact as we focus on creating secure \njobs, safe and flourishing communities, and contributing to WA’s environmental, social and governance agenda.\nThank you to my fellow directors for the energy \nand commitment they bring to their roles. I am also thankful for the strong leadership of our CEO Pat Donovan and his Executive team for driving our vision forward. Finally, I want to acknowledge Water Corporation’s employees who work tirelessly to not only deliver an essential service to the people of WA, but do so in a way that’s efficient, sustainable and helps our state and communities thrive. \nThank you for your hard work and dedication.\nRoss Love\nChair',
 'page7\n Chief Executive  \n Officer’s report  \n Mr P at Donovan\nChief Executive Officer’s reportWhat a challenging yet rewarding \nyear it has been. From natural disasters at either end of the state, to world-class events such as the Total Solar Eclipse – it’s certainly been a varied one!\nAn early highlight for me was the release of our long-awaited corporate strategy – Thrive2035 – which charts a course towards realising our strategic goals. Through the preparation of this strategy, it has become increasingly clear that tackling current and future challenges will take ambition, vision and energy. \nThis is particularly true as we come up against \nthe accelerated effects of climate change. Since announcing our pathway towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 2035, we have taken significant steps towards making that a reality. Our recent work to secure the development rights for Flat Rocks Wind Farm Stage 2 is just one example. But wind farms aren’t the only new frontier we are exploring.\nWe have begun investigating new commercial \nopportunities, as well as research and development in circular economy initiatives to better the environmental, social, and economic outcomes for the state. \nTraditionally, these activities have been delivered \nby different sections of the business. However recently, we have developed an Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy to bring them together in a cohesive, single plan and identify any material gaps. This will allow our actions to be prioritised, managed and reported centrally. As always, we continue to remain focused on managing water services sustainably and making WA a great place to live and invest.\nThis financial year we have continued to centre \nthe voice of Aboriginal People in our decision-making and promote self-determination principles, social inclusion, cultural security, and economic participation. Our Reconciliation Action Plan underpins this approach.Guided by these strategies, we have been engaging and co-designing solutions with communities under the Aboriginal Communities Water Services Program. This important body of work isn’t just about upgrading infrastructure and services to 141 communities. It’s about improving understanding, advocacy and equality across all WA communities. This is a significant chapter in our Water Corporation story, and we are proud to help write these pages for our state. \nIt goes without saying, we could not \nhave achieved any of this without the strong commitment of our people. As CEO, one of the greatest compliments to receive is knowing employees feel safe, seen and heard in the workplace.\nTaking out one of the Australian Financial \nReview’s BOSS’ Best Places to Work Awards and becoming the only Australian water utility to be \na Disability Confident Recruiter makes me proud. \nOur commitment to the safety and experience \nof our employees remains a key priority.\nBut it is the collective buy-in from our 4,000+ \npeople that uplifts our culture and embeds safety into the heart of our daily operations.\nI am sincerely thankful to all employees, \nour Board of Directors and Minister McGurk for your ongoing support and look forward to the road ahead. \nPat Donovan\nChief Executive Officer',

We are working to integrate these into our Thrive2035 strategic planning, risk management, and reporting for 2023-24. \nOur approach\nTo ensure we can meet ESG goals, we worked with independent external experts to conduct a robust assessment broadly aligned to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). \nThis enabled us to identify ESG issues and develop a plan to address them. A materiality framework was developed following a five-step process which \nincluded extensive internal and external stakeholder engagement: \n1.Define base criteria: Define business priorities, key stakeholders and value chain\n2.Identify potential topics: Create a long list of potential material topics \nbased on Water Corporation documents\n3.Categorise topics: Refine the long list of potential material topics into key categories\n4.Stakeholder engagement: Engage with stakeholders to understand each material topic in detail and relevance to the business and stakeholders\n5.Prioritise: Prioritise material topics based on the business priorities, key stakeholders, and impact on the value chain\nA total of nine ‘material topics’ were identified as being most important to our business and our stakeholders.

 '2023 Annual Report\nWater Corporation\nFinancial highlights Financial highlights\nWe continue to make a significant \ncontribution to the Western Australian economy, stimulating and supporting the state’s \ngrowth through the provision \nof water infrastructure.\nWe also provided innovative energy solutions \nto support the state’s aspirational target of zero emissions by 2050. Our surplus for 2022-23 was influenced by solid revenue receipts from our core activities, combined with higher levels of land development and building activity. This is due to a state economy that continues to perform strongly, with strong population growth leveraging off the Federal and State Governments’ policies designed to drive economic activity in the residential building industry.\nThe results featured total revenue of $3.3 \nbillion but lower overall returns to the State \nGovernment of -$195.9 million. This is because \nof the Government’s decision for us to retain the interim dividends that were forecast to be paid in 2022-23 to contribute to funding \nthe Alkimos Seawater Desalination Plant.\nOur operating business delivered \na surplus of $946.8 million.\nOperating revenue increased by 6.6 per cent \nprimarily due to a rise in service charges, water consumption and higher operating subsidies received from the Government for the provision of non-profitable services. \nContributions from land developers towards \ninfrastructure for new housing developments \nadded a further $243.6 million. These \ncontributions were received either as cash \n($143.1 million) or infrastructure handed over \nsuch as pipes and pumps ($100.5 million).\nTotal expenditure increased by 8.5 per cent to \n$2.0 billion, reflecting the cost of operating and maintaining our increasing, ageing and diverse infrastructure. The rise encompassed the effects of inflation on materials and services, a labour market with intense competition, elevated borrowing costs due to interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia throughout the year, and increased depreciation for infrastructure and technology assets. Our total cost per property increased by 4.0 per cent and our operating costs per property increased by 6.1 per cent. Despite these rises we remain one of the lowest cost businesses in the Australian water industry for large scale supply. \nOver the year we repaid $388.8 \nmillion of fixed borrowings.INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE \nWe invested $745.0 million in new capital \nprojects to expand our water infrastructure. \nOur capital investment program benefits the community and leverages off a wide range of \nlocal private sector partners to assist us in our \nconstruction, maintenance, and operations \nactivities. In doing so, we employ, both directly \nand indirectly, a significant number of Western Australians. The capital investment program \nfor 2022-23 included $316.3 million spent \non our water business, $227.9 million on our \nwastewater business with the remainder \non a range of programs including irrigation, drainage, and facilities management. \nFLAT ROCKS WIND FARM STAGE 2 PTY LTD\nWe are a significant energy consumer due to \nour desalination plants and other operational requirements. In order to minimise our environmental footprint and achieve our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, we have proactively pursued renewable energy solutions. We have acquired the rights to develop the 92.4-megawatt Flat Rocks Wind Farm Stage 2, a prominent wind energy project in Western Australia. This will enable us to generate around 25 per cent of the renewable energy required to meet our emissions target.  The windfarm was registered as a company under the Federal Corporations Act 2001 on 29 July 2022 and is wholly owned by Water Corporation. We entered into an agreement to purchase the entire share capital of the wind farm from Moonies Hill Energy Pty Ltd, which was finalised on 11 November 2022. The transfer of shares was completed on 22 December 2022. \nABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES WATER SERVICES \nPrior to 30 June 2023, the Department of \nCommunities (DoC) was responsible for  providing essential services, such as water and power, to 141 remote communities through the Remote Essential and Municipal Services (REMS) Program.

 '2023 Annual Report\nWater Corporation\nSafe for all  Safety for our customers,  \n community and employees \nWater is at the core of sustainable development. Everyone has \nthe right to access safe water from secure sources – whether your family has been here five years or 5,000 generations.\nYet, in Western Australia today, around 70 per \ncent of our Aboriginal communities are not \nconnected to a regulated water service. With an \nacute focus on seeing our state thrive, we are on \na mission to ensure everyone receives the same standard of water services, regardless of location. \nSAFE FOR ALL – ABORIGINAL \nCOMMUNITIES WATER SERVICES\nThe WA government is taking major steps in \nstandardising water and power services across \nthe state. Responsibility for these services in \n141 Aboriginal communities has moved from \nthe Department of Communities to Water Corporation and Horizon Power. Together, the two utilities will work to deliver safe and \nreliable water and power to these communities \nover the next 10 years. Our contribution to \nthis body of work is known as the Aboriginal Communities Water Services (ACWS) program.\nWe are co-designing solutions that are \nled by communities with local knowledge and experience. Every step of the way we continue to listen to local voices and, in return, be transparent with the rationale for decisions and any relevant challenges.\nCASE STUDY\nTOWN PROFILE – DJARINDJIN\nDjarindjin is one of the 141 communities \nbeing upgraded. Sitting on Bardi Jawi native \ntitle determined land, Djarindjin includes an \narea that the Goolarrgoon people call home. \nIt is situated 196km north of Broome, with a population of approximately 400 people. \nWater Corporation has been working with \nthe Djarindjin community since July 2020. We listen respectfully to the Djarindjin community to understand their unique water experiences and needs. By working collaboratively with communities, we are able to build trust, form sustainable relationships, achieve meaningful solutions, and help create an environment where self-determination can thrive.\nSafe, reliable water builds strong \ncommunities and encourages investment in local communities and people. As part of our community-led approach, we have completed asset investigation work, and are currently collaborating on a co-designed upgrade plan.\nOur CEO joined the Aboriginal Community Water \nServices team for a cultural tour near Djarindjin',
 'page27\nSafe for all Major works planned for Djarindjin include: \n• building and equipping a bore \nas a new water source \n• a water treatment plant \n• the construction of a pipeline to connect the community to the new water supply. \nThese upgrades will significantly \nimprove reliability and water \nquality for the community. \nThere are 91 water connections with data \nloggers being installed in Djarindjin. For the first time, residents will have oversight over how much water they are using. \nOur work to date with the Djarindjin \ncommunity demonstrates our commitment to drive positive outcomes for Aboriginal people, communities, employees, suppliers and contractors. \n \nThe concept of safety presents itself in many forms at Water Corporation daily. From devastating floods, to cyber security threats, to the mental health of our staff – safety is our top priority. We are always striving for continuous improvement to keep WA safe. Here are a few of our challenges and triumphs this financial year.\nFLOODING IN THE KIMBERLEY\nTeams from across Water Corporation united \nto support the state’s response to the largest \nflood event in WA history. From late-December \n2022 into early-January 2023, up to 500mm \nof rainfall inundated several towns, including \nFitzroy Crossing, Camballin, Derby and Broome.\nThorough preparation by our North West \nteam prevented major disruption to water services but we were unable to prevent damage to a wastewater pipeline attached to the Fitzroy River (Martuwarra) Bridge.The team was quick to mobilise support for the local community. Some members of our Perth-based field team even hitched a ride to Fitzroy Crossing aboard a Department of Defence Chinook helicopter. \nDespite high water levels making site access a \nchallenge, crews worked tirelessly on interim \nrepairs to the main to stop wastewater entering \nthe river. This was no mean feat considering the stifling temperatures, and difficulty moving people and materials into the area. \nIn total, more than fifty employees were \ninvolved in the response, including West Kimberley district, regional projects team, water quality experts, communications, procurement, safety and metropolitan operations. \nWe have replaced the damaged wastewater \nmain, which involved tunnelling underneath the river to increase protection from catastrophic weather events in the future. \nBUSHFIRES IN THE GREAT SOUTHERN \nWhile our North West team was responding \nto a once-in-a-century flood, our people in the Great Southern were contending with bushfires. In February, firefighters and emergency crews battled multiple fires ignited by lightning strikes in Hopetoun, Ravensthorpe and Munglinup.\nOur people were up against a multitude \nof barriers, including isolated roads and a water bombing plane crashing into the Fitzgerald River National Park. This escalated the incident to a new level.\nIt was ‘all systems go’ as trucks transported \npower generators between towns and water \ncarting commenced. With generators at our \nborefields, we were prepped to continue \nsupplying water in the event of a power outage. \nA couple of weeks later, further fires broke out in \nEsperance, Munglinup, Albany and Ravensthorpe.\nMunglinup carted water tanks in Ravensthorpe',
 '2023 Annual Report\nWater CorporationOne hundred per cent of Munglinup’s water \nis carted into the town. With the fires causing road closures, there was a serious risk to its water supply, not to mention the safety of our crews moving in and out of the area.\nHowever, with the help of emergency services \nteams, we were able to maintain supply to the \ncommunity, and avoid damage to our assets. \nResponding to incidents takes a massive \namount of on-the-ground support and behind-the-scenes logistics. Thanks to the combined efforts of everyone involved, we \nwere able to keep our people safe during the \nfloods and fires we experienced this year.\nCYBER SECURITY \nThroughout the years we have increasingly \nrelied on technology to deliver water, wastewater and drainage services across the state. Our systems help us carry out work \nsafely and reliably, and are critical to preventing \ninterruption to our essential services.\nThe security of our data, including that of our \npeople, customer, financial, operational and asset data, is non-negotiable. For anyone who watches the news, cyber security is front of mind for many organisations.\nTo ensure we stay resilient in the face of \ncyber threats, we are uplifting our technology maturity across the organisation. \nThis year, we commenced an Information \nManagement Program to improve data security, accessibility and reliability across all areas of the business. \nTo support the rollout of this program, \nnew policies, frameworks, standards and training were developed in line with Thrive2035 corporate objectives. \nThe project still has more to do in \nimplementing a data catalogue and supporting the development of capabilities in the newly formed Information Management Centre of Excellence (IMCoE). The IMCoE provides skills, tools, processes and support to enable the establishment of a sustainable model for business-led continuous improvement of information.\n‘A great place to work’ is a core objective, \nwoven into the fabric of our organisation. A huge part of this is making sure our people feel safe. Here are some of the ways we bring this objective to life.\nCHAMPIONING MENTAL HEALTH \nACROSS THE STATE \nSupporting the wellbeing of our staff is an ever-\nevolving journey. This is why we are continually improving access to resources. We now recognise mental wellbeing as part of our Safety Corporate Risk. We have adopted new Healthy Minds Safety Essential training, and introduced mandatory Blooming Minds Flourishing Workplace training for all employees. \nEvery quarter, around 800–1,000 intentional \nmental health conversations are conducted at \nWater Corporation. This means roughly 25 per cent of our workforce is engaged in these chats. \nWith the adoption of the new Code of Practice \nfor Psychosocial Hazards in the Workplace, our flagship Mental Health Champion program continued to grow. We were able to educate teams in addressing key workplace hazards through our champions. We now have 300 champions across the organisation, with our fourth cohort of employees having been trained and inducted earlier this financial year. \nDuring a recent survey, 93 per cent of \nemployees acknowledged there is awareness of mental health at Water Corporation, and 87 per cent of surveyed employees felt they would be supported by their immediate manager if they raised a mental health issue.\nImportantly, we empower our people to stop \na task when they feel unsafe. Identifying \nwhen workers feel unsafe, or a change occurs on site, offers significant insight into the \nplanning aspects of each job. However, more \nthan that, each time a job is stopped on site \nan incident may have been prevented. \nMental Health performance\n300 4800-1,000 5\ndays each \nquarterintentional \nconversationsapproximately average of\n90\nTotal number of \nMental Health \nChampions trainedTotal number of \ncohorts through \nthe Mental Health \nChampion programTotal number of \ndays for Mental \nHealth Champion \ntrainingTotal number of \ndiscussions\n(roughly 25 per \ncent of workforce \npopulation)Total number of \neducation sessions \ndelivered by the \nMental Health \nChampion*\n*approximately 90 each quarter (1,033 since inception of program in 2020)Safe for all',
 'page29DRIVING SAFETY HOME \nThe Big Breakfast Roadshow has continued \naround the state this year. This rewarding activity, which started in 2021, provides our \nemployees with the unique opportunity \nof directly engaging with the General \nManager of Operations and Head of Safety \nand Wellbeing over a cooked breakfast. \nA total of 14 meetings were carried out in \nevery region this financial year. Key highlights of the engagement led to the optimisation of procedures and enhancements to local procurement process, which allowed teams to access vital equipment more efficiently. This will vastly improve the quality of customer service provided. \nThe breakfast conversations also shone a light \non the need to drive accountability of asset performance and consistency across the state. The roadshow is only gaining momentum across the business and is a significant part of our push for safer workplaces. \nSTATE-WIDE SAFETY COMMITMENT \nOur key safety assurance process reached a \nnew milestone during the financial year. Our Safe Job Planning Program was implemented state-wide. Through this process, team leaders and management observed 8,167 Water Corporation tasks and 1,705 so they could be rated on performance against site safety measures. We also implemented the widespread adoption of digital inspections, which leveraged existing technology solutions. This means that we can operate safely, without the burden of expense and time needed to make physical inspections on site. CASE STUDY\nTHE HUMAN FACTOR\nPart of the beauty of being human is that no two people are exactly the same. Acknowledging this also means accepting it has an impact on the design and implementation of projects and assets. This financial year, we embarked on a journey to become the first water utility in Australia (if not globally) to formally integrate Human Factors Engineering (HFE) into our projects. This not only allows us to safely and efficiently manage our operations, but also puts us on the right path to satisfying our other Thrive2035 objectives of Safe for All, Great Place to Work, and Satisfied Customer.\nHFE applies the knowledge of human \ncapabilities, or ‘how humans do things’, to the design, operation and maintenance of technological systems. By applying the science of HFE around people at work, we can: \n• reduce the consequences of human error\n• improve safety performance, human reliability, efficiency, effectiveness, and user acceptance of new plants or facilities\n• reduce capital and operational expenditure costs by contributing \nto a more efficient design\n• reduce the risk of late changes or \nre-work after construction\n• improve operability and \nmaintainability of new assets.\nSo far, 10 internal projects have had Human \nFactors Engineering applied to them. The most notable project for inclusion is the new Alkimos Seawater Desalination Plant (ASDP).\nEmployees at one of our treatment plants\nSafe for all',
 '2023 Annual Report\nWater CorporationThis financial year,  we have undergone \nchanges in leadership, structure, and the prioritisation of activity that delivers \nThrive2035 and the highest value back to \nour community, customers and state.\nTRANSFORMATION\nOur corporate strategy is ambitious and will \nrequire significant transformational effort across the business. The Transformation Office was set up this financial year to \nenable the transformative change required \nfor Water Corporation to thrive. \nWith the appointment of Jacque Harding \nas General Manager of the Transformation Office, the team is working collaboratively across the organisation to:\n• schedule and prioritise projects and group plan initiatives \n• manage portfolio inter-dependencies risks and issue resolution\n• lead change management and people transformation\n• review our operating model to understand what is required to deliver Thrive2035\n• provide data-driven insights to enable performance and process improvement.\nDRIVING EFFICIENCY\nThe Focus Challenge is one example of the \nprioritised transformation portfolio initiatives. \nOur aim is to save $40 million in operational \nexpenditure in the 2023-24 financial year. The savings will help sustainability finance key strategic initiatives and set us on the pathway to successfully deliver our Thrive2035 efficiency targets.REDUCTION IN WATER LOSS THROUGH EVAPORATION \nEvaporation of water from open storage poses \na threat to our reliable supply. In the case of insufficient stored water, usually the only \noption available to residents is to cart water, \nwhich can be very costly, and increases our carbon footprint while supplying water.\nIn collaboration with The University of Western \nAustralia, we have undertaken research to \nunderstand the effectiveness and cost-benefits \nof reducing evaporation and determining \nthe overall value of the water saving. As part \nof the research, we installed Hexa-Covers, a \ntessellated floating cover made from recycled \nplastic. This product was chosen to trial as \nit reduces contact with the air, which in turn \nmeans reduced evaporation. These floating \ncovers may also help with water quality issues \nby reducing the risk of birdlife and wind-borne \ncontaminants entering the water body.\nThe trial produced a 73 per cent reduction in \nevaporation, as well as additional benefits in improving water quality for many key parameters, including a reduction in algae concentration. The solution also proved to be cost effective, leading to implementation at three sites in the Great Southern Region – Ravensthorpe, Salmon Gums and Lake King.\nThis financial year we have continued to \ndeliver programs to assist our most financially vulnerable customers, placing more emphasis on early intervention, support programs, home visits, and flexible payment options. Here’s a snapshot of the support we offer. \nFINANCIAL HARDSHIP REVIEW\nGiven the cost of living crisis throughout \nthe financial year 2022-23, we have been reviewing our hardship programs to assist more of our vulnerable customers to manage their living expenses. Five workshops have been conducted across the organisation, with representatives from Water Corporation, financial counsellors, and customers who are having difficulty paying their bill. These groups have provided valuable insight from customer and business perspectives, and will assist greatly with the updated programs. Enabling us to sustainably  \n finance our vision \nIn order to meet our Thrive2035 objectives and achieve the ambitions of our corporate strategy, we need to deliver significant business change. \nEfficient',
 'page31HARDSHIP UTILITY GRANT SCHEME\nWe are currently supporting nearly 600 \ncustomers experiencing family and domestic violence. A new process has been implemented in conjunction with the Department of \nCommunities to assist customers with mental \nhealth issues and those experiencing family \nand domestic violence. We are now able to submit outside-of-guidelines applications, which has resulted in customers only needing \nto tell their story once and receive financial \nassistance to reduce their account balances.\nE-CONCESSIONS PROJECT\nWe have a new concessions platform built into \nour website. This has vastly improved the online experience by allowing customers to update and access their concession entitlements. \nThe next stage of the project is to \nimplement a portal for our Local \nGovernment and utilities customers so \nthey can securely download concession \napplication and cancellation certificates.PUBLIC HOUSING WATER EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS \nAs part of our Waterwise Public Housing \nProject, 875 government-owned properties have been retrofitted with water-efficient \nfixtures, such as showerheads, toilets and \ntaps. This has been delivered in partnership \nwith the Department of Communities. \nLeaks were repaired, and  advice was provided  \nto help tenants make waterwise changes to their daily lives. The program helped save 133 million litres of drinking water throughout \n2022-23 and prompted a 19 per cent \nreduction in annual household water use. \nSince its inception in 2019, the project \nhas saved 373 million litres of precious water across the state and reduced household water bills substantially. \nThis year, Water Corporation and the \nDepartment of Communities delivered a \nwaterwise exemplar garden at a Mosman \nPark public housing complex to reduce water use and provide a space for the senior residents to enjoy. More than 3,000 native \nshrubs, 10 native trees and 20 fruit trees \nwere planted, with residents co-designing \nthe garden with The Forever Project.\nEfficient\nCustomers exploring our online support options',
 '2023 Annual Report\nWater Corporation\nOur desalination plants give us the unenviable role of being one of the \nhighest electricity users on the grid. To help protect our environment, we \nhave committed to securing renewable energy to help us reach our net zero greenhouse gas Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions target by 2035. \nWe are now the proud developers of the 92.4MW Flat \nRocks Wind Farm Stage 2. This is one  of the largest \nwind energy projects in WA and will be built 30km from Kojonup. \nOnce commissioned, this asset will generate around a quarter \nof the total renewable energy required to achieve our target of net zero emissions across all operations by 2035.\nTo put 92.4MW into perspective, that’s enough \npower to sustainably provide water to 600,000 homes annually. We are working with Western Power, the community and other partners to complete the project.  Accelerating environmental \n sustainability o f the water cycle  \n as our climate changes\nAround half of Perth’s drinking water comes from the Indian Ocean, but treating seawater to remove salt and impurities is extremely energy intensive. If we are to meet our Thrive2035 goals, delivering water and wastewater services with renewable energy is essential.\nEnvironmental sustainability as our climate changesWind farm\nSEQUESTERING CARBON THROUGH PINE PLANTATIONS AND REVEGETATION\nThis financial year,  we successfully amended our \nEmissions Reduction Fund. This was established under the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 by the Commonwealth Clean Energy Regulator to include a total of 1,350 ha of carbon sequestering pine plantation.  \nSince 2021, we have worked in partnership with \nthe Forest Products Commission to implement two pine plantations within the Shire of Boyup Brook and Boddington. There are more than 1.7 million pine trees planted across our two plantations. Together, they are projected to generate over 350,000 Australian Carbon Credit Units over the next 18 years, by sequestering carbon from our atmosphere and soils.In addition, we have continued our partnership with Carbon Positive Australia to plant 240 hectares of native vegetation to sequester \nnearly 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide \nequivalent (CO2-e) over the next 25 years. \nThis is more than equivalent to our entire fleet \nvehicle emissions during the financial year.\nThe 240 hectares of biodiverse native vegetation \nwas undertaken at Eurady Reserve in Nada Country in the Shire of Northhampton. Eurady Reserve, purchased by Bush Heritage Australia in 2005, is in the process of being registered under the Commonwealth Emissions Reduction Fund.\nCarbon Positive Australia aims to restore over \n1,300 ha of cleared vegetation in Eurardy, with a mix of native trees and shrubs. This protects the land from further degradation and habitat loss.CASE STUDY\nFLAT ROCKS WIND FARM STAGE 2',
 'page33To reach our Thrive2035 goals, we need to \nhave a clear understanding of our impact on the environment, so are working on a way to accurately measure and reduce our emissions.\nINSTALLING PERMANENT GHG \nMONITORING SYSTEMS \nWe are at the forefront of worldwide research \nto directly measure GHG emissions. As part \nof this research, we are installing monitoring \nsystems at all our major metropolitan water resource recovery facilitates.\nThis allows us to conduct research \ninto wastewater network odours and hazardous gases, along with measurement and modelling in sewer networks.\nWe’ve partnered with the University of \nQueensland’s Fugitive Emissions Research \nteam, the leading authority on utility GHG \nmitigation strategies in Australia. The team’s \nresearch is focused on minimising direct GHG \nemissions from urban wastewater systems. \nWe have also commenced a project with The \nUniversity of Western Australia, Melbourne Water and TasWater to address the knowledge gap on the measurement of GHG emissions at regional wastewater pond treatment plants. This project spans our many different pond treatment processes and geographical locations.\nThroughout the stages of these research \nprojects, we are collaborating on the development of standardised reporting methods in Australia and around the world. \nENSURING OUR WASTE ISN’T WASTED\nAnother objective of our research \nand development area this year was a focus on waste reduction. \nWater and wastewater treatment sludges are \noften sent to landfill where there is no current viable recycling option. Over 99% of carbon dioxide captured by bio-mass re-enters our atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle. \nWe have teamed up with Murdoch University’s \nCentre of Rhizobium Studies to look at the \npotential of turning the sludge into biochar. \nBiochar is a charcoal-like product made by \nheating organic matter (such as wastewater treatment sludge) in a controlled process \nwith limited oxygen, called pyrolysis. When \nused as a soil amendment (or fertiliser), \nthe product captures and makes negative \nemissions possible by intercepting the cycle and converting carbon into a form that is \ntypically stable for centuries to millennia.\nWe investigated biochar types for improving \nbroadacre agricultural practices. Our research specifically focused on biochar being a suitable nutrient and carbon source to improve legume productivity.We sourced biochar from our waste streams, such as powdered activated carbon from the \nDenmark Wastewater Treatment Plant and solid \nwaste from tree farms and our other plants.\nThe research showed our biochar was \neffectively used in the legume industry and successfully demonstrated another way for our waste products to avoid landfill or being incinerated. This opens the door for further research into carbon sequestering and offers an alternative to chemical nitrogen fertilisers.\nIt takes a passionate and determined \ncast of thousands to secure our water future. Working together across the state, here are other initiatives which are also propelling us down the road to net zero.\nCASE STUDY\nALKIMOS SEAWATER \nDESALINATION PLANT – \nOUR NEXT MAJOR SOURCE\nThis year, Water Corporation substantially \nprogressed the environmental assessment of Perth’s next major water source. \nLast financial year, the WA Government \nannounced the next major new source would be a seawater desalination plant at Alkimos. Declining rainfall and our growing population require us to reduce our dependence on rainfall and groundwater as a drinking water source. The ASDP will provide a secure sustainable drinking water source to the Integrated Water Supply Scheme.\nSupporting the Western Australia Climate \nPolicy (2020), we are committing to construct and operate the ASDP with net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. This means any greenhouse gas emissions produced through the construction and operation of ASDP will be avoided, minimised or offset.\nEnvironmental sustainability as our climate changes\nBiochar Field Trial of Lentils at Goomalling',
 '2023 Annual Report\nWater CorporationThrive2035 goals have shaped how we \nhave proposed to construct and operate ASDP, including many environmental commitments fundamentally aligned to accelerating environmental sustainability of the water cycle as our climate changes. Our commitments include: \nTo counterbalance essential native vegetation \nclearing, we have secured approximately 10 times the area proposed to be cleared \nfor inclusion into conservation areas \nmanaged by the Department of Biodiversity, \nConservation and Attractions. Some of this \narea includes nearly 70ha of revegetation to create new Black Cockatoo foraging habitat. \nFollowing further public consultation \non the proposal, the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) considered the implementation and operation of ASDP, published its report, and sent recommendations to the Western Australian Minister for Environment in May 2023. The EPA recommended that the proposal may be implemented subject to conditions reflecting Water Corporation’s environmental commitments proposed as part of implementing and operating ASDP.\nAt full capacity, the plant will provide 100 \nbillion litres of drinking water per year, with the first stage, to provide 50 billion litres, operational in 2028. Under our new source development program, ASDP will be the first key step towards delivering up to 125 billion litres per year of additional supply to meet the expected demand by 2035.POSITIVE LAND AND WATER IMPACTS \nThrive2035 views net clearing as a lead indicator \nfor positive land and water impacts. At a minimum, we plan to revegetate the same area of vegetation that we clear in the process of \ndelivering our water and wastewater services. \nThis financial year saw continued \ncollaboration with the Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) as part of our commitment to \npositive land and water impacts. Since the \nimplementation of this initiative in 2019, \nwe have voluntarily revegetated in excess of 235ha to counterbalance approximately 191ha of clearing. This  was needed to support the planning, delivery and maintenance of services across the state.\nA focus on the expansion of existing \nrevegetation sites for enhanced environmental values saw approximately 83ha of land revegetated this financial year. Revegetation projects this year included an additional 50ha planted at the Lakeland Nature Reserve in the Wheatbelt and an extra 33ha at the former Gnangara Pine Plantation site, situated within the City of Wanneroo.Environmental sustainability as our climate changes\nOur Boddington Pine Plantation registered \nunder the Emissions Reduction Fund\nPerth is becoming a leading waterwise city',

 '2023 Annual Report\nWater CorporationWe have continued to explore collaborative \nopportunities that contribute to the WA Government’s priorities, including \na strong economy, regional prosperity \nand a thriving, liveable environment.\nIn response to this rapidly changing \nlandscape, teamed with the urgent need to deliver our Thrive2035 strategic goals, \nwe created the Growth Portfolio. \nThe Growth Portfolio is responsible for \nidentifying potential new revenue streams, delivering commercial and infrastructure initiatives, identifying partnership opportunities, and collaborating with other Government agencies, the private sector, and relevant communities.\nCASE STUDY\nFEASIBILITY OF MAGNESIUM\nThe WA Government has committed up to $2 million, matched by Water Corporation, for a detailed feasibility study into producing magnesium hydroxide.\nOur desalination process produces a \nby-product, brine, which we currently release back into the ocean. But brine represents a valuable source of critical materials, such as magnesium. \nWe are completing the study in partnership \nwith the South West Development Commission and the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation.\nWith Thrive2035 strategic priorities \nconcentrated on supporting state development, environmental sustainability, and local solutions, our efforts are focused in the right direction. Pending the feasibility results, we can potentially provide magnesium hydroxide to the industry. Magnesium hydroxide can be used as a feedstock to support supply chains in aerospace and transport sectors, as well as in the production of other critical metals, including titanium.\nWe are well-placed to extract further value \nfrom brine. Firstly, we have access to large quantities of desalination brine as a feedstock for magnesium hydroxide production.Secondly, the growing global awareness of environmental, social and governance (ESG) will attract many direct and end-market \ncustomers looking for ‘green’ raw inputs in \ntheir supply chain and provide an additional \nbarrier to competition. The strong demand \nhas already been demonstrated by a range of local participants, such as Magnium Australia \nand the Rare Earth Elements industry.\nOverall, our intention will be to operate \nthe project on a net zero basis and \nproduce a product that is less energy and pollution intensive than products traditionally available in the market.\nAUSTRALIA’S FIRST LOW-COST HYDROGEN PROJECT\nA renewable hydrogen project near Waroona \nis on the pathway to production as we have signed a major 15-year water supply agreement.\nWestern Australia-based Frontier Energy’s \nBristol Springs Green Hydrogen Project is expected to be one of the first, low-cost renewable hydrogen projects in Australia. Production is due to commence in 2025 with Stage One production forecast at approximately 4.4 million kilograms of renewable hydrogen each year. \nWater is an essential component of \nrenewable, or green hydrogen, where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis using renewable electricity.\nThe electrolysers for the first stage of the Bristol \nSprings Project will be powered by Frontier Energy’s 114MW industrial solar farm, with any excess renewable energy sold into the grid.

CASE STUDY\nEXPANSION OF THE ORD IRRIGATION SCHEME\nThe Ord Irrigation Scheme is Western Australia’s largest irrigation system by water volume. Located in the East Kimberley region, the irrigation system is serviced by the Ord Dam, Lake Argyle and Kununurra Diversion Dam and Lake Kununurra. \nThe existing irrigated farmland is \nused for a variety of agricultural crops \nincluding maize, cotton, mango, citrus, \nwatermelon, rockmelons, pumpkin, \nchickpeas, sandalwood and chia.\nThrough state agreements and the expansion \nof available irrigable land, the irrigation scheme is undergoing an expansion and volume capability upgrade. This upgrade will increase available irrigation water supply to the Knox Farmlands with 570 million litres a day for the irrigation of a further 5,600ha of farmland. \nThis kind of agricultural progress in the \nOrd paves the way for new industries and provides genuine employment opportunities.\nThe new farmland area will also play \nan important role in the region’s burgeoning cotton industry, backed by local growers and Traditional Owners.\nSupporting state development\nKununurra Diversion Dam on the Ord River',

On current projections, annual demand in the Great Southern Region will outstrip supply by 2030, with an additional 1.8 billion litres of drinking water per annum needed by 2050. \nWe’re making great progress investigating \npotential new water sources for the Lower Great Southern Towns Water Supply Scheme (LGSTWSS). Both groundwater and desalination are options for the scheme which currently supplies more than 37,000 people in Albany, Mount Barker and Kendenup, as well as 4,000 residents in Denmark.\nPartnering with communities for long-term \nsolutions, we’ve explored how source options can be delivered in the required timeframe with the lowest environmental impact, and with the greatest long-term benefit to the region.PROUDLY PARTNERING WITH ABORIGINAL SUPPLIERS \nEach year, we purchase millions of dollars’ \nworth of goods and services. To address key commitments made in our Reconciliation Action Plan, we are harnessing that purchasing power to achieve real change for Aboriginal Australians.\nThis financial year, we have almost tripled \nthe value of contracts awarded to Aboriginal businesses across the state. To address inequity, we have awarded 5 per cent of contracts to Aboriginal suppliers.\nThe achievement follows our re-commitment to \nthe WA Government’s Aboriginal Procurement Policy which ensures Aboriginal businesses receive at least 3.5 per cent of awarded contracts. \nTo meet these government expectations, we \nmade sure contracts also achieved best value for money and complied with existing procurement legislation, policies and internal obligations.\nIn November 2021, we hosted our third biennial \nAboriginal supplier event, with the next one planned for November 2023. This provides our project managers the chance to present their capital works programs to Aboriginal businesses.\nWith the recent transfer of responsibility \nfor water services from the Department of Communities to Water Corporation, three contracts for water and wastewater asset maintenance in Aboriginal communities were awarded to Aboriginal suppliers.

With \nExmouth’s permanent population of \n2,700, and the usual holiday influx taking \nthat up to around 6,000, there was the \nanticipation of additional pressure on the town’s water and wastewater supply. \nTo service the thousands of additional \nvisitors, we played a significant part in a whole-of-government planning and working group to ensure visitors to Exmouth would enjoy the eclipse experience while protecting the pristine Ningaloo region. \nTo cater for the influx of visitors, we began \nearly investigations into key infrastructure for maintenance requirements, and identified solutions to best serve the region for the event and to benefit the scheme into the future. We worked closely with the community, the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation, and key stakeholders to install a six million litre temporary tank to provide non-potable water to the Welch Street Campsite in Exmouth, along with the installation of permanent water infrastructure. Water supply at the nearby bore field was also upgraded to increase water supply by 300,000L per day. Remedial works were also carried out at the wastewater treatment plant to prepare for increased wastewater during the event. On the demand management side, through respectful education and collaboration with the local community and businesses, we were able to save millions of litres of water through short-term alterations to gardening and commercial water use.\nThis project represents one of our biggest \ncollaborations to date, working with representatives across 14 WA Government agencies in partnership with the local government to ensure communities in the region were supported for the event. It showcased our capability to be part of WA’s potential as a centre of collaboration and knowledge building, while developing strong working relationships and learnings to take into our own state development projects.',

 'page51Accountability and \nindependence \nAs prescribed in the Water Corporations Act 1995, Directors are to act honestly, exercise due care and diligence and disclose all material personal interest in matters involving the Corporation that are raised in Board meetings. The Board has complete independence to determine the policies and control the affairs of the business subject to restrictions imposed by the Water Corporations Act 1995. Ministerial approval is required for transactions that are above a prescribed amount (currently more than $25 million) or that will result in a major initiative or are likely to be of significant public interest.\nMinisterial directions \nUnder section 64 (1) of the Water Corporations Act 1995 the Minister may give directions in writing, generally with respect to the performance of our functions and, subject to section 65, we are to give effect to any such direction. If the Minister gives a direction, it must be tabled before each House in Parliament. During the period under review, no directions were received from the Minister.\nDirectors’ and Senior Executives’ remuneration \nFor further disclosure of Directors’ and Senior Executives’ remuneration please refer to the remuneration report on page 56.\nGovernance framework \nThe Board has legislative authority under the Water Corporations Act 1995, to perform the functions and determine the policies that control our activities. \nThe Board is responsible for our overall corporate \ngovernance and approves strategic direction \nand budgets, ensuring legal compliance, \nethical behaviour and proper risk management processes are in place and operate effectively. \nComprehensive monthly reports are provided to \nthe Board to allow it to monitor performance.Internal control \nThe Board, through the Audit and Risk Committee, has oversight of the financial reporting process, the system of internal control, risk management, the audit process, and our process for monitoring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These responsibilities assist in maintaining an effective internal control structure.\nIt consists, in part, of organisational \narrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority, with comprehensive systems and control procedures. Management has the responsibility for establishing and maintaining the system of internal control that supports the achievement of our business objectives.\nThis system of internal control is designed \nto manage and mitigate rather than \neliminate the risks of failure to achieve business objectives. It can only provide \nreasonable and not absolute assurance of the \neffectiveness of the system of internal control \nimplemented by management. An important \nelement of the control environment is an \nongoing internal audit program, delivered \nby Management Review and Audit.\nTo ensure the independence of the audit \nfunction, the reporting line is to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee.\nManagement review  and audit \nOur internal audit function is managed by the Risk and Assurance Business Unit’s Management Review and Audit section, which has the authority to examine any matters referred to it by the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer. The internal audit function supports the Audit and Risk Committee and senior executives by independently and objectively reviewing the adequacy, efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control and governance system within the Corporation.\nExternal auditors\nIn accordance with the Water Corporations Act 1995, we must have the financial report for a financial year audited by the Auditor General. The Auditor General has outsourced the audit to RSM for a three-year term. Total auditor remuneration is shown in Note 25 to the Financial Statements on page 100.\nCorporate Governance Report',
 '2023 Annual Report\nWater CorporationRisk management \nRisk management is a key element of our \ngovernance framework. We have an established Risk Management Framework that provides a common understanding of risk and a set of processes for managing risk aligned with the International Standard on Risk Management ISO 31000:2018. The Framework ensures a formalised, structured and corporation wide approach to the identification, evaluation and control of risks, which have the potential to threaten the achievement of our Corporate Objectives and our ability to provide services.\nThe risk appetite has been defined to guide \ndecision making within agreed boundaries, as determined by the Board. All managers are responsible for the identification and management of risks that will impact on their business processes and subsequent objectives. The management of risk within the business is embedded at all levels, with appropriate support and systems in place to ensure risks are managed to an acceptable level.\nA comprehensive commercial insurance \nprogram is maintained covering insurable risks, \nwhich may have a significant impact on our \nassets, construction activities and legal liability.\nPerformance monitoring and reporting \nWe provide written quarterly reports and this Annual Report to the Minister for Water detailing our performance and progress made \nin fulfilling the Statement of Corporate Intent. \nA written annual report on compliance with the \nWater Services Licence was also provided to the Economic Regulation Authority. In addition, the Board and Corporate Executive received \nmonthly performance reports covering a diverse \nrange of financial and non-financial matters.\nEthical standards \nWe require all Directors, employees and \ncontractors to exercise high standards of ethical behaviour in carrying out their duties. \nOur Code of Conduct is available on both \nthe Corporation’s external and internal websites. A report on compliance is forwarded to the Public Sector Commission. \nThe Board Charter, available on our website, \nsets out the roles and responsibilities of \nthe Board and management. Under the \nguidance of the Audit and Risk Committee \nthe Charter was drafted using the Water \nCorporations Act 1995, Australian Standards and other corporate governance resources.Managing financial exposures\nWe have a central Treasury function to manage financial exposures in accordance with our Treasury Risk Management Policy. Regular reporting ensures the Board can monitor financial risk management.\nInformation security management system \nWe maintain an enterprise information security management framework that utilises a risk based approach based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework (CSF).\nState Records Act 2000 \nIn accordance with Section 61 of the State Records Act 2000 and the State Records Commission Standards (Standard 2 – Principle 6), we have an approved Recordkeeping Plan. In accordance with s.28 (5) of the Act, an updated Plan was submitted to the Minister and endorsed in September 2014. The Plan describes how records are created, maintained, managed and disposed of in accordance with our Standards and Principles. We regularly conduct audits of recordkeeping practices and system use by our staff and alliance partners. Regular in-house records and document management training is conducted and feedback and evaluation is sought from all attendees. The course is also available online for regional officers. \nWe have an online induction process for all \nnew staff, which includes information on employee roles and responsibilities and how they comply with the approved Recordkeeping Plan. It also includes ‘Information on Record Keeping and Information Management Compliance for Water Corporation’ and ‘Information Security Awareness’.\nInformation management, including \nrecords management, is acknowledged as critical to the effectiveness and success of the business and we are committed to continuously improving its management.Corporate Governance Report',

With the significant volume of wastewater conveyed across the state, it is possible unplanned discharges will occasionally occur and some of these may affect the environment, public health and public amenity. Our incident management process provides a fast and effective response to these and other incidents. Consistent with the Environmental Protection Act 1986, we report any unplanned discharges of waste that have the potential to harm the environment.\nOur environmental performance is underpinned \nby our Corporate Environment Policy and Carbon and Energy Policy. We also maintain an Environmental Management System, certified under the internal standard ISO 14001 that provides for the systematic identification of environmental risks, setting of performance targets and development of environmental improvement plans to reduce risks and ensure our activities are sustainable.\nESG Reporting \nCentral to our ESG Strategy and sustainability reporting framework are nine material topics.

 '2023 Annual Report\nWater Corporation\nNotes to the Financial Report Notes to the Financial Report\nfor the year ended 30 June 2023\nNote 1  Reporting entity \nWater Corporation (the “Corporation”) is not-for-profit entity incorporated under the Water \nCorporations Act 1995 and domiciled in Australia. Its registered office is at 629 Newcastle Street Leederville WA 6007. These financial statements cover the year ended 30 June 2023. The Corporation is primarily involved in the provision of water and wastewater services.\nOn 21 December 2022, the Corporation acquired a subsidiary, Flat Rocks Wind Farm Stage 2 Pty Ltd. The \nconsolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Corporation and its subsidiary \n(collectively the “Group”) as at 30 June 2023. Disclosures for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2022 \ncomprise of the figures for the Corporation only and have been included for comparative purposes.\nNote 2  Basis o f preparation\nThe financial report is a general-purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance with the Government Trading Enterprises Act 2023 and Australian Accounting Standards (including Australian Interpretations) adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB). The financial report complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). \nThe financial report was approved in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 29 August 2023.\nThe financial report is prepared on the historical cost basis.Amounts in the financial report have been rounded off to the nearest whole \nnumber of millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated.\nBasis of consolidation  \nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be \nconsolidated from the date at which the Group ceases to have control. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nNew or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted  \nThe Group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations \nissued by the AASB that are mandatory for the current reporting period.\nCurrent and non-current classification Assets and liabilities are presented in the Statement of Financial Position \nbased on current and non-current classification. \nAn asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold \nor consumed in the Group’s operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current. \nA liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the Group’s normal \noperating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current. \nGoods and services tax\nRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), except \nwhere the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.\nReceivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, \nor payable to, the ATO is included as a current asset or current liability in the Statement of Financial Position.\nCash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. The GST \ncomponents of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are classified as operating cash flows.',
 'page73\nNotes to the Financial ReportAccounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted\nThe following standards have been issued but are not mandatory for the 30 June 2023 \nreporting period. The Group has elected not to early adopt these standards. The Group’s \nassessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below:\nStandard Description Application date Implication\nAASB 2021-2Amendments to Australian Accounting \nStandards - Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates1 January 2023Not expected to have a material effect\nAASB 2021-5Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction 1 January 2023Not expected to have a material effect\nComparatives\nWhere appropriate, comparative amounts have been re-presented and  re-classified to ensure comparability with the current reporting year.\nNote 3  F unctional and presentation currency\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Group and its subsidiary is Australian dollars.\nForeign currency transactions\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to Australian Dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the \ntransactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.\nNote 4  U se of estimates and judgements\nIn preparing this financial report, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates \nare recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised, and any future years affected.\nThe areas where estimates and judgements are significant to the financial report, or a higher degree of \njudgement or complexity is involved, are listed below and described in more detail in the related notes:\n• Note 9  C alculation of unbilled revenue\n• Note 11  C arrying values, useful lives and impairment indicator  \n  assessment o f property, plant and equipment \n• Note 13  V aluation of service concession liabilities\n• Note 14  Impairment o f intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and  \n  useful lives assessment o f intangible assets with a finite useful life\n• Note 15  A t acquisition accounting for Flat Rocks Wind Farm Stage 2 Pty Ltd \n• Note 18  Provisions for site restoration and decommissioning\n• Note 19  Measurement o f long service leave and defined benefit obligations\nNote 5  Revenue\n5.1 A CCOUNTING POLICIES\n5.1.1  Regulated revenue\nRevenue from annual service charges and volume charges is recognised in the Statement \nof Comprehensive Income when customers are billed. The underlying revenue \nrecognition principle is to recognise revenue in the period it is consumed.\nAnnual service charges are raised based on the availability of the service to the property, \nand may include charges for water, wastewater and drainage services. \nVolumetric water and wastewater charges are based on customer metered water use. Where a \nmeter read is unable to be made, the bill is estimated based on previous meter read information. \nVolumetric water revenue includes recognition of water used by customers but not yet billed. \nMost customers are billed on a two-monthly cycle that includes a share of the annual \nservice charge based on the number of days in that two-monthly period plus volumetric charges. Bills are adjusted for any entitlement for discounts or concessions.',
 '2023 Annual Report\nWater Corporation5.1.2  Operating subsidies\nOperating Subsidies are recognised as revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that \na significant reversal would not occur and the Group has complied with the conditions \nattached to them. Operating Subsidies are received from the State Government for:\n• The difference between customer revenue and costs in respect of \ncountry water, sewerage, drainage and irrigation services;\n• metropolitan operations as approved by Cabinet; and \n• revenue foregone, plus agreed administration costs, from rebates and concessions to Pensioners, Seniors and Concessional Land customers on annual service charges, water consumption charges and other fees and charges.\n5.1.3  Developers’ Contributions\nDevelopers’ contributions are recognised as revenue at fair value when received. The Group \nreceives capital contributions from external parties in the form of either cash or assets handed \nover. These are commonly referred to as Developers’ Contributions and consist of:\nSubdivisions Infrastructure contributions\nSubdivision Infrastructure contributions are one-off charges payable by developers who apply to \nsubdivide lands to create extra lots that require the Group’s services. Infrastructure contributions help \nthe Group cover the cost of ongoing upgrades to their infrastructure such as distribution mains, main \ndrains or pumping stations. These charges are known as Standard Infrastructure Contributions (SIC) which refers to the base level service required by an average residential property in a typical urban location. Other properties with a higher level of service are assessed in multiples of this amount.\nBuilding – Infrastructure contributions\nBuilding stage Infrastructure contributions are one-off charges payable by builders/developers who \nsubmit a building application, and the building development involves a change to the water services (e.g. installation of an additional water meter, or an upgrade to a water meter). This is different from \nsubdivision infrastructure contributions such that the land will already have water and/or wastewater \ninfrastructure in place. Drainage infrastructure contributions are not payable at building stage.\nAssets Handed Over from Developers\nDevelopers are required to construct and provide water, wastewater and drainage reticulation infrastructure \nwhen subdividing land. These reticulation assets are connected to the existing network owned by Water Corporation. Developers are required to hand over to Water Corporation these reticulation assets free of charge.\nSpecial Agreements – Infrastructure contributions\nSpecial agreements only apply to ‘Major Consumers’ in regional areas. These special agreements \nare based on terms and conditions agreed by the Group and the developer (Major Consumer). \nHence, they are not based on fixed rates like the other types of Infrastructure contributions. These special agreements aim to recover the cost of providing water services to rural locations \nto ensure the risk of stranded assets is managed so that they support efficient water use.\nThese special agreement developers’ contributions are different from other types of developer \ncontributions such that charges are not based on a fixed price. Instead, the charges (known as capacity charges) are based on the daily peak entitlement and the location of the asset.\nCapacity charges for Major Consumers are calculated so that they achieve full cost recovery \nof capital expenditures by using depreciation and a return on capital method.\n5.1.4  Grant revenue\nWhere an enforceable agreement exists between the Group and the Government to transfer sufficiently specific goods or services to a customer, the Group recognises the grant income under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under AASB 15, revenue relating to such grant income is recognised based on the Group’s total expenses incurred in relation to the total expected expenses to be incurred (i.e. cost input methodology). Where the Group has not yet met the performance obligations, any amounts received in advance is recognised as a contract liability in the Statement of Financial Position. \nGrants that do not fall within the scope of AASB 15 are recognised:\n• Where the grant does not relate to capital funding, when the Group’s \ncontractual right to the grant has been established.\n• Where the grant relates to the acquisition/construction of a non-financial asset, over time as the non-financial asset is acquired/constructed.

 'page77Note 8  Income tax equivalent expense\n8.1 A CCOUNTING POLICIES\n8.1.1  Income tax equivalent\nThe Group is exempt from the Commonwealth of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 but \nmakes income tax equivalent payments to the Western Australian Government. The Group entered into the National Taxation Equivalent Regime (NTER) environment on 1 July 2001 having previously operated under the state-based Taxation Equivalent Regime. While tax equivalent payments are remitted \nto the Department of Treasury, the Group’s tax equivalent is subject to Australian Tax Office (ATO) \nadministration. The calculation of the liability in respect of these tax equivalents is governed by the \nIncome Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the NTER guidelines as agreed by the NTER Working Party.\nIncome tax equivalent expense comprises current and deferred tax equivalents. Current tax equivalent \nand deferred tax equivalent is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nCurrent tax equivalent is the expected tax equivalent payable on the taxable income \nfor the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date, and any adjustment to tax equivalent payable in respect of previous years.\nDeferred tax equivalent is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts \nof assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.\nDeferred tax equivalent is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences \nwhen they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by reporting date.\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred tax equivalent the Group takes into account the \nimpact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional tax equivalents and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax equivalent liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax equivalent liabilities; such changes to tax equivalent liabilities will impact tax equivalent expense in the period that such a determination is made.\nDeferred tax equivalent assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable \nright to offset current tax equivalent liabilities and assets, and they relate to income \ntax equivalents levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity.\nA deferred tax equivalent asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable \nsurpluses will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax equivalent assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax equivalent benefit will be realised.\n8.2 AMOUNTS RE COGNISED IN THE STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nGroup Corporation\n2023 \n$M2022  \n$M2023 \n$M2022  \n$M\nCurrent income tax equivalent expense\nCurrent year 413 385 413 385\nAdjustments from prior year (3) (1) (3) (1)\nDeferred income tax \nequivalent expense\nTemporary differences (8) (9) (8) (9)\nTotal income tax \nequivalent expense402 375 402 375\n8.2.1  Recognised in o ther comprehensive income / (loss)\nGroupBefore tax \n2023 \n$MTax expense \n2023 \n$MNet of tax \n2023 \n$MBefore tax \n2022 \n$MTax expense \n2022 \n$MNet of tax \n2022 \n$M\nRe-measurement of defined  benefit liability(1) - (1) 3 (1) 2\nNotes to the Financial Report',

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on similar credit characteristics.\nOther receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any allowance for expected credit losses.\n9.1.2  Impairment\nThe Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets which are either \nmeasured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. The measurement of \nthe loss allowance depends upon the Group’s assessment at the end of each reporting period as to \nwhether the financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, based \non reasonable and supportable information that is available, without undue cost or effort to obtain.\nWhere there has not been a significant increase in exposure to credit risk since initial recognition, a \n12-month expected credit loss allowance is estimated. This represents a portion of the asset’s lifetime \nexpected credit losses that is attributable to a default event that is possible within the next 12 months. \nWhere a financial asset has become credit impaired or where it is determined that credit risk has increased \nsignificantly, the loss allowance is based on the asset’s lifetime expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit loss recognised is measured on the basis of the probability weighted present value of anticipated cash shortfalls over the life of the instrument discounted at the original effective interest rate.Notes to the Financial Report',

In doing so, the Group has estimated the following:\nExpected volume – the Group has estimated the volume of water that it will continue to \ntake on the basis of past usage and availability of the water. The Group considers factors \nsuch as long term rainfall data and climate change in making its estimates. \nExpected unit cost – the Group has estimated the expected unit cost on the basis of the Group’s \nadjusted Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) for new sources of water.

The Group recognises a \nlease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined \nas leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). For these short-term leases, the Group recognises the lease \npayments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic \nbasis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid \nat the commencement date using the Western Australian Treasury Corporation’s incremental borrowing rate. The liability is remeasured when there is a change in the future lease payment.\nExtension optionsSome property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group up to one year before the end \nof the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options \nin new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the \nGroup and not by the lessors. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably \ncertain to exercise the extension options. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise \nthe options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control. \nNotes to the Financial Report',

 'page91Note 18  Provisions\n18.1  A CCOUNTING POLICIES\n18.1.1  Provisions\nA provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive \nobligation that can be measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and \nthe risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.\n18.1.2  Workers’ compensation\nThe Group self-insures for risks associated with workers’ compensation for claims relating to pre-1 July \n1997 events. Outstanding claims are recognised when an incident occurs that may give rise to a claim and are measured at the cost that the Group expects to incur in settling the claims, discounted using a government bond rate with a maturity date approximating the terms of the Group’s obligation.\n18.1.3  S ite restoration\nA provision for site restoration costs is recognised when: there is either a legal or \nconstructive obligation to restore a site; the land is contaminated; it is probable a \nrestoration expense will be incurred; and the costs can be estimated reasonably.\n18.1.4  Decommissioning\nThe Group has a constructive obligation to decommission and dispose of aspects of the \nwater, wastewater and drainage network.

 '2023 Annual Report\nWater CorporationProvision for decommissioning\nThe Group has recognised a provision for decommissioning obligations associated \nwith facilities no longer utilised or scheduled for closure by the Group. Recognition \nof a provision is consistent with the Group’s legal requirements. \nNote 19  E mployee benefits\n19.1  A CCOUNTING POLICIES\n19.1.1  Long service leave and annual leave\nProvisions for long service leave and annual leave are maintained to provide for employee benefits which \nare assessed on the basis of calculated leave liabilities for employee service to the reporting date.\nAnnual leave provisions are classified as current, as there is no unconditional right to defer settlement for at \nleast 12 months after the end of the reporting period. The provision for annual leave is calculated at the present value of expected payments to be made in relation to services provided by employees up to the reporting date.\nLong service leave provisions are classified as current liabilities as the Group does not have an unconditional \nright to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.\nPre-conditional and conditional long service leave provisions are classified as non-\ncurrent liabilities because the Group has an unconditional right to defer the settlement \nof the liability until the employee has completed the requisite years of service.\nThe provision for long service leave is calculated at present value as the Group does not expect to wholly \nsettle the amounts within 12 months. The present value is measured taking into account the present value of expected future payments to be made in relation to services provided by employees up to the reporting date. These payments are estimated using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement, and discounted using market yields at the end of the reporting period on Commonwealth Government bonds with terms to maturity that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\n19.1.2  P urchased leave\nA provision for purchased leave is maintained to provide for purchased leave benefits which are assessed on the basis of calculated leave entitlements at reporting date.  \nThis scheme allows employees to purchase up to 12 additional weeks leave per annum by agreeing to a reduced \nsalary rate over 52 weeks of the year. The minimum amount of leave available to be purchased is 1 week. \nThis scheme also allows employees to take reduced salary of eighty percent for four years \nand have paid leave for the whole of the fifth year at eighty percent of their salary.\nValues are calculated at undiscounted amounts based on wage and salary rates that \nthe Group expects to pay as at reporting date including related on-costs.\n19.1.3  Termination benefits\nTermination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised if the Group has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.\n19.1.4  Non-monetary benefits\nNon-accumulating non-monetary benefits, such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised goods and services, are expensed based on the net marginal cost to the Group as the benefits are taken by the employees.Notes to the Financial Report',

The calculation of defined benefit obligations \nis performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.\nRe-measurements of the net defined liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, are recognised \nNotes to the Financial Report',
 '2023 Annual Report\nWater Corporationimmediately in Other Comprehensive Income. The Group determines the net interest expense on the net \ndefined benefit liability for the period by applying the discount rate, used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period, to the net benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to the defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.\nNature of the benefits provided by the Schemes\nPension Scheme – The employer-financed benefit is a pension benefit payable on \nretirement, death or invalidity, or a lump sum benefit on resignation.\nGSSS – Some former Pension Scheme members transferred to the GSSS. In respect of their transferred benefit, \nthe members receive a lump sum benefit at retirement, death or invalidity which is related to their salary during their employment and indexed during any deferral period after leaving public sector employment. \nDescription of the regulatory framework\nThe schemes operate under the State Superannuation Act 2000 (Western Australia) and the State Superannuation \nRegulations 2001 (Western Australia). Although the schemes are not formally subject to the Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) legislation, the Western Australian government has undertaken (in a Heads of Government Agreement) to operate the schemes in accordance with the spirit of the SIS legislation. As exempt public sector superannuation schemes (as defined by the SIS legislation), the schemes are not subject to any minimum funding requirements. As constitutionally protected schemes, the schemes are not required to pay tax.\nDescription of other entities’ responsibilities for the governance of the Schemes\nThe Government Employees Superannuation Board (GESB) is the schemes’ trustee and is \nresponsible for the governance of the schemes. As trustee, GESB has a legal obligation to act solely in the best interests of scheme beneficiaries. GESB has the following roles:\n• Administration of the schemes and payment to the beneficiaries when required in accordance with the scheme rules;\n• Compliance with the Heads of Government Agreement referred to above.\nDescription of risks\nThere are a number of risks to which the Schemes expose the Group. The \nmore significant risks relating to the defined benefits are:\n• Legislative risk – The risk is that legislative changes could be made which increases the cost of providing the defined benefits.\n• Pensioner mortality risk – The risk is that pensioner mortality will be lighter than expected, resulting in pensions being paid for a longer period.\n• Inflation risk - \n• Pension Scheme - The risk that inflation is higher than anticipated, increasing pension payments, and the associated employer contributions.  \n• GSSS - The risk that wages or salaries (on which future benefit amounts will be based) will rise more rapidly than assumed, and/or that inflation (which affects the indexation of deferred benefits) will be \nhigher than assumed, increasing the defined benefit amounts and the associated employer contributions.\nDescription of significant events\nThere were no scheme amendments affecting the defined benefits \npayable, curtailments or settlements during the year.\nReconciliation of the net defined benefit liability\nGroup Corporation\n2023 \n$M2022 \n$M2023 \n$M2022 \n$M\nPension Scheme 30 29 30 29\nGSSS 2 3 2 3\nNet defined benefit liability 32 32 32 32Notes to the Financial Report',

 '2023 Annual Report\nWater Corporation30.2  CREDIT RISK\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails \nto meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.\nManagement has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on a regular basis. \nThe credit risk on financial assets, which have been recognised on the Statement of Financial Position, other than cash and other financial assets is generally the carrying amount, net of any impairment loss for expected credit loss. Most receivables relating to water service charges are the responsibility of and are recoverable from the owner of the property. Under legislation, the Group may lodge and register a memorial and appropriate endorsements on the title of properties in arrears, which when in place restricts any instrument affecting that property from being registered without the Group’s consent. Other receivables are regularly reviewed and allowance is made for expected credit loss.\nThe Group has established an expected credit loss that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect to \nits financial assets, primarily trade and other receivables, and comprises individually significant exposures.\nAt reporting date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.\nCash held at bank earns interest at rates determined by the Department of Treasury. For the \nyear ended 30 June 2023, the weighted average interest rate was 2.53% (2022: 0.58%).\nExposure to credit risk\nThe Group is not materially exposed to any individual customer.\nTrade receivablesThe Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. \nHowever, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, \nincluding the default risk associated with the nature and location of each customer. In monitoring customer \ncredit risk, customers are grouped according to their geographical locations as well as their account category. It \nis noted that in the majority of cases, the Group has security over the properties of the customers and as such has a very low credit risk. The Group adopted a lifetime expected loss allowance in estimating expected credit \nlosses to trade receivables through the use of a provisions matrix using fixed rates of credit loss provisioning.\n30.3  LIQUIDITY RISK\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Corporation will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they \nfall due. The Corporation’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Corporation’s reputation. \nOn an annual basis, the Board approves the forward five-year forecast of cash flows incorporated in the \nStrategic Development Plan (SDP). On an annual basis, the Board also approves the projected cash flows, for the current and next financial years, derived from the Statement of Corporate Intent (SCI). The SDP and SCI convey the liquidity risk by reporting projected net debt levels with committed facilities. During the financial year, any significant divergence from the projected cash flows is reported to the Board. \nThe Corporation ensures that it maintains a liquidity buffer of $4 million on a daily basis in approved liquidity \ninstruments to cover cash flow volatility over the short-term and to provide time to arrange additional \nfunding facilities in the event of a cash flow emergency. Funds held in excess of liquidity requirements \nmay be used to retire debt in a manner consistent with the approved liquidity and funding strategy. \nThe Corporation has in place arrangements for Western Australian Treasury Corporation (WATC) to provide \nfinance, with total facility limits set by the State Treasurer through the annual State Budget, or as amended \nfrom time-to-time by a formal process including the Mid-year Review or via letters of amendment. \nFor 2022/23, the borrowing limit was set at $5,472 million (2022: $5,429 million) for the repayment of maturing \ndebt and ongoing capital expenditure. Included in the limit of $5,472 million is a liquidity facility that can be drawn down, within the constraints of the total limit, to meet short-term financing needs, and a working capital facility currently limited to $80 million (2022: $80 million) to assist with cash flow management.\nAs at 30 June 2023, $5,040 million (2022: $5,429 million) was drawn under the total debt facility. \nThe remaining amount available under the total debt facility, with the relevant approval was $432 \nmillion (2022: $nil). For 2023-24, the facility limit has initially been set at $5,678 million (Facility limit \nfor 2022-23: $5,437 million) providing available borrowings of $638 million up to 30 June 2024. \nOutstanding lines of credit are regularly discussed and agreed with WATC. The type, currency and term \nof any new finance are determined at the time of draw-down between the Corporation and WATC.Notes to the Financial Report',

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising return.\nThe Group enters into derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market \nrisks. All such transactions are carried out in line with risk management policies. Generally, the \nGroup seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in surplus or deficit.\n30.4.1  C urrency risk\nThe Group makes purchases that are denominated in currencies other than Australian dollars. The currencies in which these transactions primarily are denominated in are Euro and USD.\nIn accordance with risk management policies, non-material exposures to an aggregate \nvalue of $100,000 for any one project may be left unhedged. At any one-time, unhedged \nexposures in all foreign currencies cannot exceed an aggregate value of $1,000,000.\nThe Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than \none year from reporting date. When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.Notes to the Financial Report',
 'page107The Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk.\n30.4.2  Interest rate risk\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk through financial liabilities and adopts a policy of ensuring \nthe majority of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a fixed rate basis.  \nProfile\nAt reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest bearing financial instruments was:\nGroup Corporation\n2023 \n$M2022 \n$M2023 \n$M2022 \n$M\nFixed rate instruments\nWATC Term Floating Rate Lending 1,873 1,873 1,873 1,873\nWATC Term Fixed Rate Lending (Note a) 3,167 3,556 3,167 3,556\nTotal financial liabilities 5,040 5,429 5,040 5,429\nThe fair value of the WATC Term Floating Rate Lending and Fixed Rate Lending respectively as at 30 \nJune 2023 was $1,893 million, and $2,978 million (2022: $1,890 million and $3,418 million).\nNote (a)  The fixed debt portfolio is structured with 30 lines spread o f 10 year fixed \nrate debt with a fairly regular quarterly maturity cycle and with 4 lines of \n20 year fixed rate debt which was entered into during 2021/22.\nFair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments\nThe Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, \nand the Group does not designate the forward points component of derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. Therefore, a change in interest rates at reporting date would not affect equity.  \nCash flow sensitivity analysis for floating rate instruments\nBorrowings under the Term Floating Rate Lending facility are structured into various debt lines, with maturities \nbetween 2 years and 5 years.\xa0 Interest rates under the Term Floating Rate facility are reset every 3 months or 6 months.\xa0Of the total $1,873 million under this facility, $500 million will mature in the next 12 months, with interest rates fixed for either 3 months or 6 months.\xa0 An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased interest expense (before capitalised interest) by $18 million. A decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have decreased interest expense (before capitalised interest) by $18 million.\xa0 This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.\nNotes to the Financial Report',

I did not receive the other information prior to the date of this auditor’s report. When I do receive it, I will read it and if I conclude that there is a material misstatement in this information, I am required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and request them to correct the misstated information. If the misstated information is not corrected, I may need to retract this auditor’s report and re-issue an amended report.\nResponsibilities of the directors for the financial report \nThe directors of the Corporation are responsible for:\n•keeping proper records\n•preparation of the financial report in accordance with the Government Trading Enterprises \nAct 2023, including section 176 and the Government Trading Enterprises Regulations 2023 that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Corporations Regulations 2001 \n•such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for:\n•assessing the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern\n•disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern\n•using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Western Australian Government has \nmade policy or funding decisions affecting the continued existence of the Corporation.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report\nAs required by the Auditor General Act 2006 , my responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nfinancial report. The objectives of my audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. \nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.\nA further description of my responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located on the \nAuditing and Assurance Standards Board website. This description forms part of my auditor’s report and can be found at https://www.auasb.gov.au/auditors_responsibilities/ar3.pdf.\nMy independence and quality management relating to the report on the financial report\nI have complied with the independence requirements of the Auditor General Act 2006 and the relevant ethical requirements relating to assurance engagements. In accordance with ASQM 1 Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, the Office of the Auditor General maintains a comprehensive system of quality management including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.',
